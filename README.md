## Example

Serve `index.html` from a local web server (for example `npx serve`) and open it
in a browser. The page loads `main.js`, which imports `first_transfer_point.js`
to render a simple 3D map of Taiwan using Three.js. Click the red cones to zoom
from an angled view to a top-down view of that location.
